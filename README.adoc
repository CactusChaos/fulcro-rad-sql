= SQL Database Plugin

A plugin for using SQL databases with Fulcro RAD (UNSTABLE)

== Configuration

In order to use the SQL plugin you must use Fulcro config support and include configuration for data pools.
You may also optionally turn on schema management/generation.

The general layout of a config (which commonly includes `config/defaults.edn` on your classpath) should include:

[source,clojure]
-----
...
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.sql/databases
   {:main {:sql/schema         :production
           :hikaricp/config    {... see below ...}}}
...
-----

The primary keys in the databases section are database names.
You may have any number of databases in your application.
Each database uses a schema name, which defines which attributes in your model belong in that database.

This allows you to do things like create more than one database with the same schema and shard users across them.

=== Database Connection Pools

This library includes a wrapper for HikariCP connection pools.
You should configure it according to the documentation of that library by including settings for the following options in the application configuration (where each entry will become a Property for HikariCP):

[source,clojure]
-----
...
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.sql/databases
   {:main {:hikaricp/config          {"dataSourceClassName"     "org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource"
                                      "dataSource.user"         "postgres"
                                      "dataSource.password"     ""
                                      "dataSource.databaseName" "example"
                                      "dataSource.portNumber"   "5432"
                                      "dataSource.serverName"   "localhost"}
           :sql/auto-create-missing? false
           ...}}
...
-----

You should include a component in your application that starts the connection
pools. For example in mount, along with a function
that can return a clojure jdbc db spec. For example:

[source, clojure]
------
(ns com.example.components.connection-pools
  (:require
    [mount.core :refer [defstate]]
    [com.example.components.model :refer [all-attributes]]
    [com.example.components.config :refer [config]]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.sql :as sql])
  (:import (com.zaxxer.hikari HikariDataSource)))

(defstate connection-pools
  :start
  (sql/create-connection-pools! config all-attributes)
  :stop
  (sql/stop-connection-pools! connection-pools))

;; The following assumes only one database and schema...
(defn get-jdbc-datasource
  "Returns a clojure jdbc compatible data source config."
  []
  (let [ds ^HikariDataSource (some-> connection-pools :main)]
    {:datasource ds}))
------

This latter function must be used with your parser to generate
a map in the env from schema names to usable connections. See <<Resolvers>>.


=== Schema Generation

You can enable basic schema generation with the following configuration:

[source,clojure]
-----
...
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.sql/databases
   {:main {...
           :sql/auto-create-missing? true
           ...}}
...
-----

The automatic schema generation just tries to generate columns in tables if (and only if) they do not already exist.
This is reasonable for really fast startup of a project, but is almost ceratinly insufficient for real projects.

As such this plugin includes functions that can leverage Flyway to execute migrations.

=== Schema Validation

TODO. It would be nice if there was a system that could verify that the declared attributes actually exist and at least have the correct type on the database.

=== Using Flyway

See the Flyway documentation for specific details, but the bases are as follows:

1. Create migrations with names like `Vx.y.z__description.sql` in
`config/sql_migrations` (on the CLASSPATH).
2. Include the following in your application configuration:

[source,clojure]
-----
...
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.sql/databases
   {:main {:flyway/migrate?          true
           :flyway/migrations        ["classpath:config/sql_migrations"]
           ...}}
...
-----

== Attributes

RAD attributes that will be used in an SQL database can be configured as follows (where the sql namespace is `com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.sql`):

`::sql/tables`:: (required) A set of strings.
For identity attributes this set MUST contain exactly ONE table name.
Other attributes may be designated to live in more than one table.
`::sql/column-name`:: (optional) A string to use as the SQL table name.
If not supplied it uses the `(name attr-key)`, which may not be a valid SQL identifier.
`::sql/schema`:: (required) A keyword.
Defines which schema this attribute is meant to be used in, which affects generation of schema and resolvers.

TODO: Relations support.

== Resolvers [[Resolvers]]

The library supports generation of batched resolvers that can run correct queries against tables that can be installed into your Pathom parser.

You can generate resolvers with `sql/generate-resolvers`, which accepts a sequence of attributes (made with `defattr`) and the name of the schema.

If you have more than one schema, simply call this function multiple times.
It returns a sequence of resolvers that can be installed into your parser.

Also remember to set up the env so that it includes a map from schema name to
the desired connection that the resolver should use. The generated resolvers
use https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc[Clojure JDBC], so the values
in this map should be db-specs compatible with that.

NOTE: Should we port up to the newer next.jdbc lib?

NOTE: The parser construction should allow wrapping the call to the parser so you can start a transaction.
This will be fixed in the near future.

(pathom/new-parser config
    (fn [env]
      (assoc env
        ::sql/databases {:production (pools/get-jdbc-datasource)}))
    [(sql/generate-resolvers all-attributes :production)])
